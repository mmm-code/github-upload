# The rules for the patterns you can put in the .gitignore file are as follows:

# Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.

# Standard glob patterns work, and will be applied recursively throughout the entire working tree.

# You can start patterns with a forward slash (/) to avoid recursivity.

# You can end patterns with a forward slash (/) to specify a directory.

# You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (!).

# GitHub maintains a fairly comprehensive list of good .gitignore file examples for 
# dozens of projects and languages at https://github.com/github/gitignore if you want a # starting point for your project.
